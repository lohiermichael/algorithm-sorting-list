# algorithm-sorting-list

This repository will gather different algorithms of list sorting.  It will highlight the performance of the **Divide to Conquer** paradigm in the context of the exercise of sorting a list.

## Introduction to the problem

This exercise is often the first exercise to approach the paradigm of **Divide to conquer** and has different solutions around this concept

### Input

Given a list of n integers: 
`L = [a1, ..., an]

### Goal 

We want to return the sorted list of L: 
`sorted_L = [a.s(1), .... a.s(n)]` so that  <br>
a.s(1) < a.s(2) < ... < a.s(n) 

## Solutions

### Insertion sort

### Bubble sort

### Merge sort

### Quick sort
